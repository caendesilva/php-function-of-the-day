# PHP Function of The Day

A static website built with PHP to showcase obscure and underrated built-in PHP functions

## About

The website is generated statically using PHP, with a JSON database assembled from a dataset created using code in the `src` directory, interactingwith data in the `docs` folder.
The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the static website files hosted on GitHub Pages, through the `docs` directory.

### Attributions

The database generator uses dataset by [Exact.io](https://www.exakat.io/en/top-100-php-functions/), of the 100 most popular functions 
found in almost 2000 open source PHP projects, in order to diff out the most popular functions and highlight the lesser known ones.
